# Linear Mixing Model of Dimensionality Reduction to Reconstruct Fingerprints
 
This R code was developed to perform a linear mixing model of dimensionality reduction to reconstruct fingerprints. The code uses principle component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) techniques to reduce the dimensionality of the input data. The reduced data sets are then clustered using K-means clustering, and the silhouette score is calculated for each cluster to evaluate the clustering quality. The code outputs a plot that compares the silhouette scores for each clustering method.
